Tensor class? IMMUTABLE - mostly
- image/region function: returns tensor representing region within larger tensor
- max function: returns the max value of a region in the tensor
- "cross-correlate" that applies filter to a single region
- "cross-correlation map" function that applies filter to all points in tensor.

For layers:
- allimages function: all X*Y sized images in the input "image" (assuming input is always just 2d image). Could use an iterator to do this, using region function in tensor class. Similar to yield in python.







note: could optimise copyRegion function, by making it so that it doesnt recalculate coordsToHornerIndices every time. can just increment some values.
(edit: redundant)
